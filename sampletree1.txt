Making huffman tree!
Original list of individual Huffman trees (str):
('b',2,None,None,None)
('a',1,None,None,None)

Merging trees to make a complete Huffman Tree:
Merging tree ('a',1,None,None,None) and ('b',2,None,None,None) to make ('ab',3,'a','b',None)
	Merged child trees left ('a',1,None,None,0) and right ('b',2,None,None,1)
Merging done!
Final tree
('ab',3,'a','b',None)


Original text was 3 characters in length which, with 1 byte per character, would be 3 ASCII bytes!
The encoding table is:
'a':0
'b':1
New text is 3 bits in length, which is 1 bytes! (Plus we'd also have to store the decoding table as well.)
That is 33.33% of the size
